# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The model was trained using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree** algorithms, and a **Streamlit** app is provided for interactive web deployment.

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dataset Description

### Heart Disease UCI Dataset ‚Äì Overview

This dataset is a cleaned version of the original Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, made available via Kaggle.

## üöÄ Model Description

The project includes the following machine learning models:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Tree**: A classification model that makes predictions based on tree-like structures where each node represents a feature decision.

The models were evaluated and compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary libraries, such as:
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `streamlit`
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

1. To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open a web interface where you can input patient data and get heart disease predictions.

## üìÑ Model Training

1. Train the KNN and Decision Tree models using the provided scripts:
   - `knn.ipynb` for K-Nearest Neighbors
   - `dtree.ipynb` for Decision Tree

2. The trained models are saved and can be reloaded for making predictions.
